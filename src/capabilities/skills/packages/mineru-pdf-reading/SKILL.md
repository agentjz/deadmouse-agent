# MinerU PDF Reading

Use this skill when the user gives you a PDF or asks for content from a scanned or layout-heavy document.

1. Call `mineru_pdf_read` instead of `read_file`.
2. Let MinerU produce Markdown artifacts under the project state directory; tokenless runs may use the Agent lightweight API.
3. If the PDF is still remote, acquire it first with `download_url` so the document chain can continue locally.
4. Read only the needed subset of the extracted Markdown for downstream reasoning.
5. Prefer citing extracted structure, headings, sections, and page evidence over raw binary guesses.
