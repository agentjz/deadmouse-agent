# MinerU PPT Reading

Use this skill when the user gives you a slide deck and wants its content extracted or summarized.

1. Call `mineru_ppt_read` instead of `read_file`.
2. Let MinerU produce Markdown artifacts under the project state directory; tokenless runs may use the Agent lightweight API.
3. Summarize slide structure, titles, and ordered content before diving into details.
4. Keep any follow-up reads focused on the exact slides or sections still needed.
