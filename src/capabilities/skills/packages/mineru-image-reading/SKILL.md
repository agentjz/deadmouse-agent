# MinerU Image Reading

Use this skill when the user gives you a document-like image and wants OCR or layout-aware extraction.

1. Call `mineru_image_read` instead of `read_file`.
2. Let MinerU produce Markdown artifacts under the project state directory; tokenless runs may use the Agent lightweight API.
3. Prefer structured headings, tables, and OCR output over manual visual guessing.
4. Keep follow-up reads narrow by opening only the Markdown slices you still need.
