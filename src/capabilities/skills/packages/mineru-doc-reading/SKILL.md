# MinerU Doc Reading

Use this skill when the user gives you a Word document and the goal is to read or analyze its content.

1. Call `mineru_doc_read` first for both `.doc` and `.docx`.
2. When no MinerU token is configured, `mineru_doc_read` can use MinerU Agent lightweight parsing before falling back.
3. For `.docx`, accept the explicit native `read_docx` fallback only when both MinerU precision parsing and Agent lightweight parsing are unavailable, failing, or unsupported.
4. Preserve `write_docx` and `edit_docx` for document creation and structured edits.
5. Work from the extracted Markdown or fallback structure summary instead of raw binary bytes.
